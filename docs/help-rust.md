# Rust Language

## Overview

Enter Rust: a safe, concurrent language with the performance of C and C++.

Rust is not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented
characteristics.

Rust is not a functional language, although it does tend to make the
influences on a computation’s result more explicit, as functional languages do.

Rust resembles C and C++ to an extent, but many idioms from those languages don’t
apply, so typical Rust code does not deeply resemble C or C++ code.

## Syntax

### Types

u64 ia an unsigned 64-bit integer.
i32 is a signed 32-bit integer;
u8 is an unsigned eight-bit integer (used for “byte” values)


By default, once a variable is initialized, its value can’t be changed,
but placing the mut keyword (pronounced “mute”, short for mutable) is possible
